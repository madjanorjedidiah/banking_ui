# banking_ui

This a frontend application I built with react for my banking application developed with django. I wanted to try out react and learn how to implement redux. Basicaly the app was developed to make financial transactions as the customer is on the move before getting to the bank. It was a way that I thought would help reduce the length of time spent at the banks waiting for transactions to be processed without being billed for online transactions.
